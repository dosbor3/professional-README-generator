#  Swift Professional-README.md Generator
A command-line application that dynamically generates a professional REDME.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.  

To invoke the application, the following command is necessary:

*  node index.js

The user will then be given the command-line application that accepts user input.  When the user is prompted for information about an 
application repository, then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the following sections:

*  Project Title
*  Description
*  Table of Contents (clickable)
*  Installation
*  Usage
*  License
*  Contributing
*  Tests
*  Questions
